# Week4-CodeQuiz-CP
This is Corey Parker's week 4 homework, code quiz. 

This has been the most challenging homework for me yet. 

My biggest struggles/achievements were:

1. Getting lines 222 - 228 to function correctly. I was having a hard time not reading [object Object] when I printed to the DOM. I was able to overcome this by using storedScoreboard[i].score. Previously I was trying to just use storedScoreboard[i]

2. Similarly one lines 77 - 124, I was incorrectly calling quizQuestions[questionIndex].rightAnswer
I was using object/array calling incorrectly.

3. It was a good learning curve to call functions from other functions to really break the program down into smaller pieces. 

4. Learning to correctly use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse took some time as well.
